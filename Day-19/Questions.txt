Q3)In a bustling game development company named Game Corp, the foundation of every title begins with the Game class, which holds the basic features like the game’s name and the ability to start it. The company’s Adventure Division then extends this base, adding exciting mechanics for exploring vast maps filled with mysteries. Finally, the specialized Treasure Hunt Team takes over, building on the Adventure Division's work by hiding clues, designing treasure puzzles, and placing secret chests throughout the world. As the lead developer, your mission is to connect these three levels of development so the final game flows seamlessly — first showing the title, then letting the player explore adventurous maps, and finally allowing them to solve clues and unlock the treasure chest. The player’s journey begins with a tap on “Start Game,” continues through thrilling map explorations, and ends with the golden moment of victory when they open the treasure chest and see the words “You Win!” shining on the screen.
